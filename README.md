# Binary Search Algorithm in Rust
This code defines a function binary_search that takes a slice of integers arr and a target integer target, and returns the index of target in arr if it exists. If target is not found in arr, the function returns None.

In the main function, we define an array arr and a target value target, and then call the binary_search function with these values. If target is found in arr, we print its index; otherwise, we print a message indicating that target was not found.
